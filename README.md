This project explores which recipe features are most associated with high ratings using the Recipes and Ratings dataset. The analysis includes exploratory data visualization, feature engineering, and a predictive modeling pipeline.

## Introduction

This project uses the **Recipes and Ratings** dataset from Food.com, a large-scale collection of user-submitted recipes and their corresponding reviews. The dataset consists of over 230,000 reviews and 230,000+ recipes posted since 2008, making it an ideal source for exploring trends in food preferences and cooking behavior.

The main question I want to explore is: **What makes a recipe well-rated on Food.com?**  

I aim to identify which recipe features like preparation time, nutritional content, or complexity, are most associated with high user ratings. Ultimately, I want to predict the average rating of a new recipe before it receives any user feedback.

Understanding which features contribute to higher-rated recipes can help cooks tailor their recipes for success, start a recommendation systems on cooking platforms, and reveal insights about user preferences. 

This analysis has practical value both for individual users and platforms aiming to improve recipe suggestions or highlight high-potential meals.

### Dataset Overview  

After merging the original datasets, I worked with a cleaned dataset containing approximately **230,000 rows**.

Here are the key columns used in my analysis and modeling:

| Column           | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `minutes`        | Total time required to prepare the recipe                                   |
| `tags`           | Descriptive tags such as "easy", "vegan", or "holiday"                      |
| `nutrition`      | A list containing [calories, total fat, sugar, sodium, protein, saturated fat, carbohydrates] as percent daily values |
| `n_steps`        | Number of steps in the recipe                                                |
| `avg_rating`     | The average user rating for the recipe, computed from all submitted reviews |
| `description`    | The user-submitted text description of the recipe                           |

This combination of numeric and textual metadata provides insight for predicting a recipeâ€™s potential success.

## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

### Data Cleaning

The raw dataset was comprised of receipe metadata and user-submitted reviews. I performed a **left merge** on the recipe ID to consolidate all of the information. After the merge, I cleaned and transformed the data by removing zero ratings. If a rating had a value of 0, I replaced it with `NaN`, since they indicated an absence of a rating rather than a low rating. I computed `avg_rating`, which represented the average user rating for each recipe. This become the target variable for prediction. The nutrition column was originally a stringified list. I parsed it into individual numeric columsn for `calories`, `total_fat`, `sugar`, `sodium`, `protein`, `saturated_fat`, and `carbohydrates`. Finally, reciepes without an average rating were removed from the modeling set. Cleaning the data helped structure to analyze and model for the data analysis.

| calories | total_fat | sugar | sodium | protein | saturated_fat | carbohydrates | avg_rating |
|----------|-----------|-------|--------|---------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| 138.4    | 10.0      | 50.0  | 3.0    | 3.0     | 19.0           | 6.0            | 4.0         |
| 595.1    | 46.0      | 211.0 | 22.0   | 13.0    | 51.0           | 26.0           | 5.0         |
| 194.8    | 20.0      | 6.0   | 32.0   | 22.0    | 36.0           | 3.0            | 5.0         |
| 194.8    | 20.0      | 6.0   | 32.0   | 22.0    | 36.0           | 3.0            | 5.0         |
| 194.8    | 20.0      | 6.0   | 32.0   | 22.0    | 36.0           | 3.0            | 5.0         |

### Univariate Analysis

#### Distribution of Average Ratings
<iframe src="assets/avg_rating_dist.html" width="800" height="500" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Most recipes tend to be rated quite highly, with a strong right skew toward 5-star ratings. This bias in user feedback is important to consider when interpreting model performance.

#### Distribution of Calories

Calories are heavily right-skewed, with most recipes under 1,000 calories but a few extreme outliers reaching up to 40,000+. We retained these for modeling but scaled the features appropriately.

### Bivariate Analysis

#### Minutes vs Average Rating

This scatter plot reveals a weak negative trend between cooking time (minutes) and average rating. Users slightly prefer quicker recipes, though high-rated dishes exist at all durations.

#### Steps vs Average Rating

This box plot shows that recipes with fewer steps generally earn higher ratings. However, recipes with more steps tend to have more variation, potentially reflecting the challenge (and reward) of complex dishes.
